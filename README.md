# f(ai)rytales

Welcome to **F(ai)rytales**. This is an app for making bedtime stories with AI, made for children and their parents. I built this app using Java and Android Studio. The idea is to let users make their own characters and stories. The app lets you create characters and then make stories with them. You can pick where the story happens, either by writing a place or choosing on Google Maps. You also give ideas for the story plot.

F(ai)rytales is more than just an app. It is a way for children and parents to be creative together. It helps them make their own stories and enjoy reading them. This app is for having fun and learning at the same time.

### Customization and Interaction
The app offers an interactive and user-friendly interface where you can:

* **Create Unique Characters**:  In F(ai)rytales, you have the freedom to create a variety of characters for your stories. You can choose a character's name, which can be anything you like. Also, you can decide their age, making them young or old, to fit your story. There's an option to select an occupation for each character, which could be anything from a brave knight to a clever scientist. Plus, you can write a background story for each character, giving them a past that makes your stories more interesting and rich in detail.
* **Choose Your Setting**: F(ai)rytales gives you the flexibility to set your story anywhere you imagine. You have the option to type in a custom location, which could be a real-world place or a fantasy setting from your imagination. Whether it's a bustling city, a remote village, or an enchanted forest, the choice is yours. For those who prefer a more visual approach, the app integrates with Google Maps. This feature allows you to browse the map and select a location, adding an element of realism and geographical accuracy to your story. This blend of real and imaginary settings provides a vast canvas for your storytelling, making each tale unique and tailored to your creative vision.
* **Shape Your Story**: F(ai)rytales offers you the creative freedom to outline the plot of your story as you see fit. Whether you have a specific theme in mind or a detailed plot outline, the app is designed to accommodate your ideas. You can provide a brief suggestion for a storyline or delve into more detailed descriptions, setting the stage for the characters and the adventures they will embark on. The AI in the app then takes your input, whether simple or complex, and weaves it into a coherent and engaging narrative. This feature allows for a wide range of storytelling possibilities, from straightforward tales for younger children to more intricate plots for older users, making each story a unique creation of your own imagination.
