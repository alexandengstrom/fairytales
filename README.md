Welcome to **F(ai)rytales**. This is an app for making bedtime stories with AI, made for children and their parents. The idea is to let users make their own characters and stories. The app lets you create characters and then make stories with them. You can pick where the story happens, either by writing a place or choosing on Google Maps. You also give ideas for the story plot.

### Customization and Interaction
The app offers an interactive and user-friendly interface where you can:

* **Create Unique Characters**: You have the freedom to create a variety of characters for your stories. This can be real characters as yourself and your friend but i can also be made up character or historical persons.
* **Choose Your Setting**: Decide where the story should take place by writing a location, either a real one like your home town or a made up one.
* **Shape Your Story**: When creating a story you can also include some information about what you want the story to be about.

### Colors and Language Support
The app has two color themes. A normal theme and dark mode. Dark mode activates automatically based on the devices settings.

The app supports English, German, French, Spanish and Swedish languages. This means both all text inside the app will show in the prefered language but also the stories will be genereted in the chosen language. The language will be choosen automatically based on the devices settings. English will be used per default if the language is not supported.

### Technical Implementation
**F(ai)rytales** is built using Java in Android Studio, applying the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. The idea is to build the application in three layers. View, ViewModels and Models.

### Future Enhancements
One of the key enhancements planned for **F(ai)rytales** is to evolve the storytelling process into a more dynamic and interactive experience. The concept is to build the story in sections, rather than crafting the entire narrative in one go. At the end of each section, users will have the opportunity to choose from various paths, leading to different story developments. This approach is inspired by advanced "choose your own adventure" games, adding a layer of interactivity and engagement to the storytelling process.

Another feature I would like to add is to generete an image to every story aswell. This could be solved by using the Dall-E API and should not be that hard to implement.

However, this project was part of the course TDP028 at Link√∂ping University and due to the academic deadline i did not have time to implement this functionality.
